        Fraser Coast Tourism & Events and Fraser Coast Regional Council decided
        late today that in the interest of public health and safety, the
        festival should be postponed until the current outbreak is under
        control. The event was expected to attract thousands of participants,
        with many travelling from southeast Queensland where many areas have now
        been placed into lockdown.

        “Mary Poppins is one of the most resilient characters in literary
        history, so it makes perfect sense that the festival remains a feature
        of the 2021 event calendar” Event Manager Robyn Peach said. “Postponing
        it to the 26th-29th of August is in the best interest of the community
        and the event, which will remain a celebration of the wonderful world of
        storytelling through the imagination of artists from a variety of
        mediums”.
