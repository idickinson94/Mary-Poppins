        So, you’ve filled your calendar to the brim with magical Mary Poppins
        moments? Don’t forget to plan your stay on the Fraser Coast while you’re
        at it. The Fraser Coast is a region of amazing diversity with some of
        Queensland’s great icons on our doorstep. This is the home of big nature
        experiences – where you can stand dwarfed by centuries-old trees that
        grow from sand on Fraser Island, swim with giant humpbacks as they play
        along the Hervey Bay coast or in the company of hundreds of manta rays
        off Fraser Island. It is also the place of simple pleasures, offering
        families a wide choice of relaxing activites, without the stress of
        crowds often present at larger tourist areas.
