              In this competition participants will be looking to sweep the
              competition out the way and clear out their chimney the fastest.
              One at a time, chimney sweeps will race to the chimney with
              bucket, balloon and sweep in hand. Using the sweep push the
              balloon up and out the chimney, before clicking your heels and
              making your way back to the start line.
